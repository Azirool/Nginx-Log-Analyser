# Log Analyzer Tool

This is a basic shell scripting tool that analyzes nginx access logs. The goal is to extract useful information from the logs, such as the top IP addresses, most requested paths, response status codes, and user agents.

## How to Use

Run the shell script with the log file as an argument:
   ```bash
   ./log-analyser.sh <log-file-path>
   ```
